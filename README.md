# ml-pipeline-using-kubeflow-on-AWS-EKS
This repository contains the releveant code used for generating kubeflow pipeline on aws EKS services, the documentation contains the detail information regarding kubernetes cluster generation accoring the load requirement, and its management. The ideas are taken from AWS official EKS work shops and redditmlpipeline. My appraoch is to understand and learn the machine learning service deoployment using microservices on cloud. Thank you for your interest.

### For further Step by Step guid, please visit my "Notion Documentation" link:

### Future Scope:
1. currently, I am working on improving the accuracy of project using different NLP appraoches, which include, seq-to-seq model, transferlearing appraoch using BERT. And, also try to tune the parameters.

### Issue:
Unfortunately, due to AWS cloud9 repository issue, I could not add the model repo here, I will do it later. Thank you.
